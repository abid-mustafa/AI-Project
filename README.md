This is a project that I made with a group member for my 3rd Year AI Project. 
It uses two different sklearn models, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier 
(Random Forest performed better as can be seen in the evaluation txt file) to predict a disease based on a set of symptoms.
I used Flask for the backend, my group member made the front end using html, css and javascript
